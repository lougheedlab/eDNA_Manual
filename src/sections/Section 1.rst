Synopsis of the workshop & purpose of this document
===================================================

Environmental DNA (eDNA) underlies non-invasive, reliable, and cost-effective
molecular approaches that are increasingly being used for species monitoring, biodiversity
assessment, and tracking pathogens. eDNA refers to genetic material sampled from
environmental sources such as water, soil, or air, without directly sampling tissue. eDNA
derives from various sources, including intact cells, cellular organelles (mitochondria and
chloroplasts), DNA adsorbed onto particles, pieces of tissue, or even whole microorganisms.
eDNA sampling typically involves collecting environmental samples and isolating DNA, often
through filtration, centrifugation, or precipitation. These approaches rely on the fact that
organisms leave their DNA in the environment, making it possible to know which species are
present without seeing or capturing them. However, reliable eDNA data depend on rigorous
field and lab technique, and properly trained personnel because significant biases can occur
throughout the process from sample collection to data processing and interpretation; such
biases can greatly influence species detection results.

The aim of this eDNA workshop is to provide a general overview of the procedures
used in eDNA studies for both single-species and multi-species detections. This 5-day course
will benefit those interested in undertaking eDNA studies themselves, reading and
interpreting the peer-reviewed literature, or evaluating proposals, especially for management
and monitoring applications. The workshop includes lectures, demonstrations and practical
training but does not require detailed prior knowledge of genetics (we do though assume that
participants know the basics of DNA and simple lab methods). We offer a background on eDNA
origins, methods, and applications with key emphases on how to design, implement, analyse,
and interpret data from species-specific and multi-species eDNA methods. Advantages and
limitations of each approach will be given, as well as the precautions needed through the
whole process to obtain robust data. Theory will be complemented by hands-on training in
field and lab protocols.

This document presents an overview of eDNA approaches and provides guidance from
study design, sampling, sample processing and storage, laboratory methods, data processing
to interpretations. It complements the theoretical and hands-on training that is provided
during the workshop. We provide a glossary at the end of the document.
