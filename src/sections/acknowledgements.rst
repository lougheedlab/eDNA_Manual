This manual was prepared initially as part of an environmental DNA workshop offered
at the Queenâ€™s University Biological Station (QUBS). We thank the amazing station staff for
facilitating multiple iterations of the workshop and for their warm hospitality. The workshop
and our various environmental DNA projects have been supported by multiple funding sources
including an NSERC Alliance grant, a SSHRC Frontiers grant, and NSERC Discovery grant, a
South Frontenac Lake Ecosystem grant, and the Baillie Family Chair in Conservation Biology.
BioRad Canada and QIAGEN Canada have generously supported our workshop at QUBS.
