## Project Structure

The manual is created using the Sphinx tool, and section text is written in the 
[reStructuredText (RST)](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) format (also see the 
[Sphinx tutorial](https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/), which has some additional information on using RST).

The project is roughly structured as follows:

* Section files are stored in the [./src/sections](./src/sections) folder. 
* Images are stored in the [./src/images](./src/images) and should be high-resolution and, preferably, PNGs.
* Tables are stored either as images or as CSVs in [./src/tables](./src/tables) folder, or alternatively are defined 
  in-line in the section RST files.
